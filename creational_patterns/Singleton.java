Singleton definition:
    - Ensures that a class only has one instance that is globally accessible.

Why a Singleton?
    - To control access to a shared resource such as a database or a file.
    - To provide global access to this instance of a class.
    - To prevent the variable from being overwritten.

How to implement a Singleton:
    - Make the default constructor private.
    - Creation of the instance should be done statically.
